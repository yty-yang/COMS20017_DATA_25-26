## Lecture recordings:
All lecture recordings eventually appear on Blackboard a few hours after the event. Click on Re/Play on the left menu bar on the BB course webpage to find them.

## Labs:
* The labs come with exercises as Python notebooks.  
* A new set of exercises will be released every _TWO_ weeks for a total of 4 new sets of exercises. The answers will be released in time for the 2nd session of each lab.
* Material in the labs may appear in the exam.
* The labs are the primary route for feedback on all aspects of the course, including lectures, any problem sheets and exams, not just the labs!
* The lab exercises will be released in the /Labs/ folder. See top of this page.
* TAs: Eddie Goodings, Jordan Frost, Ava Raisian, Archie Walton, Yu Qin, Xinyi Zheng, Conor Oâ€™Sullivan, Lexing Zhou



## Teams:
* The unit is on Teams at [[COMS20017: Algorithms & Data 25-26]](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Avgs9mp3x4IUWyg7sP4Xqra9OLBtg5k8xQstCtIerRNI1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=afb514d3-f58e-4fef-a26f-8db851c3654a&tenantId=b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b).  You should have access already through the "Teams" panel.  If not, please get in touch with the COMS Student Enquiries Mailbox at coms-student-enquiries@bristol.ac.uk. Please make sure you set NOTIFICATIONS to ON for this channel.

You should use the Teams channel for raising queries on any aspects of the COMS20017 Data unit - such queries will not normally be answered via email or via personal Teams messages. Please do not get upset if your query is not answered by email or Teams when sent on a one-to-one basis. Post your query on the unit's Teams channel for the benefit of others who may have the same query.

## Exam info:
* This Data part of the unit is assessed 100% by a multiple-choice exam.
* The exam is closed-book (so no additional materials are allowed). There will not be a Formula Sheet.
